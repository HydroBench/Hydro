TODO

1) Split the kernels into smaller pieces => measure the impact on performances
2) Try to do boundary limits in the device so that no more Uold transfers are needed
3) allocate alligned arrays and adjust the corresponding dimensions (As it the C++ version)
4) Check if the MPI version is still working
