Small manual for HydroC
-----------------------


To compile hydroc, adapt the Makefile to your local
installation. Normally, the different variables should be explicit
enough.

The current Makefile has the possibility to build hydroc with various options:

MPI=O	    to create a MPI version (default node only version)
MIC=O	    to produce a native version for the MIC
PG=O	    to use gprof profiling tool
XHOST=O	    to build a tightly coupled binary to your local CPU, will get an invalid instruction on a not compatible hardware.
AVX=O	    to force AVX usage
AVX2=O	    to force AVX2 usage (Haswell)
ATOM=O	    to force SSE4 for the atom
SSE=O	    to force SSE usage (Nehalem)

PNG=O to produce PNG images (PPM otherwise). Images are forced to be
less than 2000 pixels wide so the program will shrink then if needed
(yet still compute the full nx x ny domain).

VERB=O	    for a verbose output of the vectorization

NOVEC=O to inhibit vectorization (for vectorization speedup
measurement)



so 

make MPI=O PNG=O AVX=O clean hydroc

will clean everything then build hydroc with MPI capability and AVX
optimization plus produce PNG images rather than PPM.

make MPI=O PNG=O AVX=O run

will recompile hydroc if necessary and start hydroc 

The input file looks like this:

_______________________________________________________________


where lines beginning with a # are ignored.

Warning : Physical time is the (unitless) time of the physics
simulated here. It has nothing to do with the elaps time of the
computation.


Meaning of the keywords of interest:

tend = physical time at which the simulation should end. Might take a
couple of runs ;-)

nstepmax = maximum number of iterations for a single run

# driving the outputs
noutput = number of iterations between two VTK dumps
dtoutput = interval of physical time between two VTK dumps
dtimage = interval of physical time between two images (PNG or PPM)

chkpt = if not 0, produce a checkpoint file at the end of the run.

nx, ny = total size of the domain. An MPI run will divide those values
according to the number of tasks.

nxystep = unused in this version

tilesize = the size of the side of a tile (excluding the ghost cells)

morton = if 1, the OpenMP threads will pick tiles according to a
morton curve

prt = if 1, print all arrays ... 

dx = (unitless) physical size of a cell

boundary_XX = kind of boundary condition on a given border of the domain
	    1 = reflexion
	    2 = absorption
	    3 = periodic

testcase = one of the hard coded test cases (0 = center explosion, 1 =
corner explosion, 3 = sinus curve explosion)


_______________________________________________________________


When a runs reaches either nstepmax or its time limit and chkpt=1, a
file Continue.dump is produced.


When a runs reaches tend, a STOP file is created, preventing any
further runs. If you need to go further along the simulation, change
tend and remove this file.

The global environment variable BRIDGE_MPRUN_MAXTIME specifies the
maximum total ELAPS time of a run in seconds (defaul is 30 mn if not
set).


on an IvyBridge with 24cores, a nx=1000,ny=1000,tend=1 takes 7s
on an IvyBridge with 24cores, a nx=2000,ny=2000,tend=1 takes 22s

for a 2000x2000 testcase (testcase=0), useful results are obtained for
tend=1000 at least.

Warning: the VTK output can become rather huge (>> GB). It is written
in the current directory as a Dep folder. It is piloted by the
Hydro.pvd file. Use paraview (www.paraview.org) to post process the
results. Be careful that a 5000x5000 test case can exhaust all the
memory with paraview.


If your run has produced PNG images (e.g. tend=1000, dtimage=10), the
faitfilm script can be used to produce a movie of your computation
(requires mencoder [and mplayer]).

Enjoy.
