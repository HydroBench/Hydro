Adapt one of the run*.sh files to your need.  

Please pay attention that the produced output can be rather
bulky. Your probably want to make sure that RUNDIR points to a file
system with enough space.

To use with FTI
---------------

download FTI-0.9.2 at https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/fti/
follow instructions given in FTI for installation and look at the example for configuration file
change hydro compilation options in make_icc_mpi or make_gcc_mpi


To visualize the result of the C versions
-----------------------------------------

cd to the $RUNDIR directory

start paraview (can be found here http://www.paraview.org/)

Load the Hydro.pvd file.
Then Apply
Change mode from Outline to Surface
Change mode from Solid Color to VarIP

Go to last time step
press Rescale to Data Range

You should have a pretty picture of your simulation.
Enjoy.
